In the second case, Mrs. Ortiz has felt a lot of discrimination from Rebecca due
to her children and her different language. The main problem between those women
was the Rebecca’s disagreement because of the noise produced by Mrs. Ortiz’s
children at the clinic when she was waiting her appointment’s turn. At that
moment, Rebecca thought that her work-place and work-environment were
inappropriate for those kids who were playing, however, the way that she took to
solve the issue was inadequate since it generated a big conflict and then
created a bad image of WIC. What are some assumptions that people make about WIC
participants Due to the Rebecca’s complaint with WIC, some people are going to
make negative assumptions about of the participants of that company even someone
could file a legal claim. The most severe assumption will be that the racism and
discrimination from the company’s employees to the patients; that’s why a
conflict must be solved though a regular protocol and thus fulfill the different
parameters stipulated by the enterprise without get offending any sensibilities
or excluding anyone. In that case, Rebecca could have spoken directly to Mrs.
Ortiz and have explained to her in a cordial way what was wrong, perhaps she
would have recognized the mistake and taken control over her children. However,
mocking about Mr. Ortiz was not correct and maybe the enterprise will have to
take action with Rebecca for her behavior, in that way WIC will clear its name.
Can you think of other examples where these assumptions could lead to conflict?
There are many cases where an act of discrimination can trigger a conflict even
a war. For example in the Middle East and Europe exist discrimination between
some countries that are inhabited by foreign people with different skin color or
even a different religion and those conflicts have been the main cause for many
deaths throughout the history. On the other hand, an assumption could lead a
conflict at university, for instance, many forms of discrimination among
students and teachers have achieved expulsions from the institute or even
suicides, and therefore the protocol takes relevance between a simple or serious
problem. Says What might work better? Rebecca tells the participant, “If you
don’t get control of your children, you’ll have to reschedule your appointment
for another day and get your checks then” Rebeca calls Mrs. Ortiz and tells her
“I’m sorry Mrs. Ortiz, Do you speak English? Because I >need that your children
stay calm and quiet, it’s due to WIC’s policies since the noise can disturb
other patients. Thank you so >much and I apologize if I have bothered you, I
hope you understand this”
