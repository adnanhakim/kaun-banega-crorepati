# Attendance Manager

## About

An android application designed to keep track of attendance throughout the semester. This is my first Android application.

This application was designed keeping in mind the timetable of my college, DJSCE. Timetable is provided and changes with respective batches. Attendance can be marked in 'Mark your attendance' or quickly done with a left swipe on each subject, or can be cancelled with a right swipe. This also provides total overall attendance, subjects and its attendance at a glance.

The timetable is hard-coded into the application hence enabling it to work offline. Attendance is saved in SQLite.

## Technology Stack

1. Developed using Android (Java)
1. Data stored in SQLite
